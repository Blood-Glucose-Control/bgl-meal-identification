# Blood Glucose Control with [WAT.ai](https://watai.ca/) and [Gluroo Imaginations Inc](https://gluroo.com/).

## Prandial Change Point Detection from Continuous Glucose Monitors

### Project Goals

### Phase 1
1. **Meal Identification** develop the ability to identify unlabelled meals in time series BG data. The goal of this project is to be able to identify the top 'n' most significant meals of a PWD per day from continuous glucose monitor data alone. The time series detection models are evaluated on various metrics that measure the proximity of the identified meal regions or change poitns to ground truth labels.

## Background

Diabetes requires a unique way of living. For most, to successfully manage the disease and avoid its long-term adverse effects, you must have detailed fitness and nutrition tracking, not unlike professional athletes or bodybuilders, but with the added complication of knowing how and when to administer insulin. Some can get away without detailed monitoring if they are highly habitual. For most, that’s an undesirable restriction, but where a Person with Diabetes (PWD) falls on that scale is a trade-off that depends on the individual.

At Gluroo, they aim to alleviate PWD's cognitive burden by making fitness, nutrition, and insulin tracking as streamlined as possible. With good tracking and monitoring, the PWD may learn minor behavioural modifications that improve their BG control. Learning these modifications on your own can take months or years of experimentation and often requires waiting months for long meetings with diabetic care professionals to evaluate what changes are necessary. For this project, our aim is to develop tools for improving short-term prandial (meal-time) / postprandial outcomes by providing counterfactuals to PWDs and their diabetic care practitioners.

> improved short-term decisions -> improved long-term disease outcomes

Many things impact a ‘relatively successful’ prandial BG behaviour, the main behavioural ones to focus on tend to be insulin dosing quantity, insulin dosing timing, basal insulin requirements, physical activity (in preceding hours and immediately postprandial), quantity of carbohydrates consumed, glycemic index of carbohydrates consumed, alcohol consumed with meal (slows absorption of carbs), amount of fat and protein consumed with meal (slows absorption of carbs but creates a delayed glucose spike).

If we can provide counterfactuals that improve PWD’s postprandial BG characteristics, we will have made thousands to millions of people’s lives significantly easier and more enjoyable, we will be increasing their freedom to enjoy a wider variety of foods safely, and potentially extending their years living a happy and healthy life.
