Gluroo aims to simplify diabetes management by streamlining the tracking of fitness, nutrition, and insulin use for people with diabetes (PWD). This project focuses on improving short-term prandial (meal-time) and postprandial blood glucose outcomes for people with type 1 diabetes, a complex disease that affects nearly 10 million people worldwide. We aim to leverage semi-supervised learning to identify unlabelled meals in time-series blood glucose data, develop meal-scoring functions, and explore causal machine-learning techniques. Our goal is to provide actionable insights to PWD and their care practitioners, enhancing health outcomes and quality of life.
